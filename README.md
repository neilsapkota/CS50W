
CS50W Search Project

Objective:
The goal of this project is to expand on the functionality of a basic search engine by creating a custom front end for Google Search. This involves exploring and understanding Google's interface, identifying the required GET parameters, and incorporating the necessary HTML and CSS elements into your website.

How It Works
Project Requirements:
Three Pages:
Regular Google Search (index.html)
Google Image Search
Google Advanced Search

Navigation:
Links on the Google Search page to navigate to Image Search or Advanced Search.
Links on Image Search and Advanced Search pages to return to Google Search.

Google Search Page:
User can input a query, click "Google Search," and view the search results.
Centered search bar with rounded corners.
Centered search button beneath the search bar.

Google Image Search Page:
User can input a query, click a search button, and view Google Image search results.

Google Advanced Search Page:
User can input four fields based on Google's advanced search options.
"All these words"
"This exact word or phrase"
"Any of these words"
"None of these words"
Fields should be stacked vertically, left-aligned, and resemble Google's Advanced Search page.
"Advanced Search" button should be blue with white text.
Clicking the "Advanced Search" button takes the user to the search results for their given query.

"I'm Feeling Lucky" Button:
Added to the main Google Search page.
Clicking this button takes users directly to the search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.

CSS Aesthetics:
The CSS should mirror Google's aesthetics for a cohesive and familiar user experience.

How to Run
